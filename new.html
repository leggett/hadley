      <b>Writer</b>

        mentorship program.
      </p>
      <p>
        My first novel manuscript, <em>A BETTER MOTHER</em>, was chosen for
        Round 7 of
        <a href="https://authormentormatch.com">Author Mentor Match</a>. It
        tells the story of a struggling widow who loses her daughters to foster
        care and will do anything to get them back. More than a custody battle,
        it’s a story of loss and redemption, and finding help in unexpected
        places.
      </p>

      <b>Reader</b>
      <p>
        I firmly believe you can’t be a writer without being a reader first. I
        try to read at least one novel per week, and I’m a subscriber of way too
        many lit mags. I’m also a fiction reader for
        <a href="http://longleafreview.com/masthead/" class="title"
          >Longleaf Review</a
        >.
      </p>

      <b>Mother of three</b>
      <p>
        Mothering breaks me down and builds me up in ways I never expected, and
        my role as a mom is integral to my life as a writer. I wrote the rough
        draft of my novel in three-hour chunks, while my youngest daughter was
        in preschool, and these days I squeeze in revisions between packing
        lunches and folding laundry. But my kids keep me sane through the
        inevitable stream of rejections and disappointments in my writing life.
        And whenever I start to take myself too seriously, I go build a Lego
        castle.
      </p>

      <b>My winding path</b>
      <p>
        I should have realized I wasn’t cut out to be a doctor on my first day
        in anatomy lab, when I sat down on a wooden crate and discovered my seat
        was filled with hemisected human heads. I nearly passed out—on that day,
        and also about 37 more times throughout my illustrious medical career.
        But I persevered through four miserable years, only to graduate still
        dreaming of becoming a writer.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'd fallen in love with storytelling as a child, but as a people-pleaser
        born into a family of scientists, it never occured to me I could become
        a writer. That would be like aspiring to be a Hollywood actress, or a
        mermaid-unicorn-fairy princess. So I dutifully earned my bachelor’s
        degree in biochemistry and went to medical school, like any good
        literature-lover would do.
      </p>
      <p>
        After leaving medicine, it took me ten more years—and another graduate
        program, this time in science journalism—to learn to trust myself and my
        writing dreams. In May 2018, I enrolled in my first fiction class at
        Hugo House. I’d finally found my home.

        love nothing more than to connect with other emerging writers, and
        especially other writer-parents! Writing can be a long and lonely road,
        and without the community I’ve gained through organizations like Hugo
        House, Pen Parentis, and Writerly Love, I never would have made it this
        far. For a bulleted list of my career U-turns, you can find me on
