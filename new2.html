				I should have realized I wasn’t cut out to be a doctor on my first day
				in anatomy lab, when I sat down on a wooden crate and discovered my seat
				was filled with hemisected human heads. I nearly passed out—on that day,
				and also about 37 more times throughout my illustrious medical career.
				But I persevered through four miserable years, only to graduate still
				dreaming of becoming a writer.
			</p>
			<p>
				I'd fallen in love with storytelling as a child, but as a people-pleaser
				born into a family of scientists, it never occured to me I could become
				a writer. That would be like aspiring to be a Hollywood actress, or a
				mermaid-unicorn-fairy princess. So I dutifully earned my bachelor’s
				degree in biochemistry and went to medical school, like any good
				literature-lover would do.
			</p>
			<p>
				After leaving medicine, it took me ten more years—and another graduate
				program, this time in science journalism—to learn to trust myself and my
				writing dreams. In May 2018, I enrolled in my first fiction class at
				Hugo House. I’d finally found my home.
			</p>

			<b>Writer</b>
			<p>
				My recent work has been published in
				<a
					href="http://www.literarymama.com/creativenonfiction/archives/2019/09/all-clear.html"
					class="title"
					>Literary Mama</a
				>,
				<a href="https://fiftywordstories.com/tag/hadley-leggett/" class="title"
					>50-Word Stories</a
				>, and
				<a
					href="https://halfwaydownthestairs.net/2020/03/01/i-wont-by-hadley-leggett/"
					class="title"
					>Halfway Down the Stairs</a
				>, and you can find my science writing at
				<a href="https://www.wired.com/author/hadley-leggett/" class="title"
					>WIRED.com</a
				>. In February 2020, I was selected for the AWP Writer-to-Writer
				mentorship program.
			</p>
			<p>
				My first novel manuscript, <em>A BETTER MOTHER</em>, was chosen for
				Round 7 of
				<a href="https://authormentormatch.com">Author Mentor Match</a>. It
				tells the story of a struggling widow who loses her daughters to foster
				care and will do anything to get them back. More than a custody battle,
				it’s a story of loss and redemption, and finding help in unexpected
				places.
			</p>

			<b>Reader</b>
			<p>
				I firmly believe you can’t be a writer without being a reader first. I
				try to read at least one novel per week, and I’m a subscriber of way too
				many lit mags. I’m also a fiction reader for
				<a href="http://longleafreview.com/masthead/" class="title"
					>Longleaf Review</a
				>.
			</p>

			<b>Mother of three</b>
			<p>
				Mothering breaks me down and builds me up in ways I never expected, and
				my role as a mom is integral to my life as a writer. I wrote the rough
				draft of my novel in three-hour chunks, while my youngest daughter was
				in preschool, and these days I squeeze in revisions between packing
				lunches and folding laundry. But my kids keep me sane through the
				inevitable stream of rejections and disappointments in my writing life.
				And whenever I start to take myself too seriously, I go build a Lego
				castle.

				Please reach out and say

				Twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/hadl" target="_new">@hadl</a>. I’d
				love nothing more than to connect with other emerging writers, and
				especially other writer-parents! Writing can be a long and lonely road,
				and without the community I’ve gained through organizations like Hugo
				House, Pen Parentis, and Writerly Love, I never would have made it this
				far. For a bulleted list of my career U-turns, you can find me on
