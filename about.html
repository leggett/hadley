            <!-- <h2>About the author</h2> -->
            <p>
              <b>Hadley Leggett</b> lives and writes in Seattle, WA. After moving all over the United States during her
              childhood, she’s taken an equally winding career path including degrees in medicine, biochemistry,
              Spanish, and science journalism, as well as a ten-year stint as a stay-at-home mom. She began writing
              fiction — a secret lifelong dream — when her youngest child started preschool and she finally got a moment
              to herself.
            </p>
            <p>
              Leggett’s short stories and essays have appeared in the Bellevue Literary Review, Literary Mama, and
              Halfway Down the Stairs, and her science writing can be found at Wired.com and Stanford News. She lives
              with her husband, three children, three cats, and an ever-rotating troop of foster kittens. When she’s not
              writing, you can find her swimming laps, poring over a jigsaw puzzle, or buying too many books.

            <p>
              When Hadley Leggett showed up in my Yearlong Class in the fall of 2018, she was still in the relatively
              early stages of what has become her superb, very moving debut novel, All They Ask is Everything,
              forthcoming from Lake Union in 2024.
            </p>
            <p>
              The novel tells the story of three women each determined to be the perfect mom—for the same two little
              girls. Accusations fly as bio mom, foster mom, and estranged grandmother vie for custody, until the truth
              shatters everything they thought they knew about motherhood.
